# NAM Plugin simplified Overview
This project aims to simplify the existing [NAM plugin](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin) codebase to facilitate later adaptation and to determine if it is possible to run NAM models and/or impulse responses on the [Daisy Seed platform](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed). 

The main focus is initially on reducing complexity and ensuring compatibility with the target hardware, so once the initial simplification is complete, the next phase will involve porting the codebase directly to the Daisy Seed platform.
